An interactive Etch A Sketch project built using JavaScript and Flexbox.

## Features
- **Brush Mode**: Click and drag to draw on the grid.
- **Resize Grid**: Users can adjust the grid size between 50 and 100.
- **Clear Grid**: Clears the drawing while maintaining the current size.

## Upcoming Features
- **Eraser Mode**: Allows users to erase drawn cells.
- **Darken Mode**: Darkens the color of a cell with each pass.
- **Lighten Mode**: Lightens the color of a cell with each pass.
- **Rainbow Mode**: Random colors are applied to each stroke.
- **User Pick Brush Color**: Allows users to choose a custom brush color.

## How It Works
1. The grid is created dynamically based on the selected size.
2. Clicking and dragging over the cells colors them in **Brush Mode**.
3. Users can resize the grid by entering a new size (between 50 and 100).
4. A "Clear" button resets the grid while maintaining the current size.
